    <p>Almost all cuisines around the world have their own version of rice pudding. A classic sweet dish made out of rice and a few other ingredients like sugar and cinnamon, it's always a comforting meal. This delicious German take on it makes for a creamy and perfectly sweet recipe that can be eaten as a breakfast, snack, and sometimes as lunch or dinner when served with additional fruit, apple sauce, or fruit compote.
